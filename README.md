## the idea
The main idea behind this project is to provide a solid frontend for data that is being collected on nodes in a cluster.

## How does it work
This page need it's data from somewhere right? That data comes from two other programs that you need to have running. 
1. [DataAPI][1]
2. [NodeAPI][2]
   
Read their Readme for installation instruction.

## Setup
Just drag and drop all files in their respective directory on your web-server. You should really know how to do that if you run a clustered service of any kind!
